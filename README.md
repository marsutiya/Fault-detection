# Fault-detection
In the current situation of Indian electrical power grids, when a small disturbance is seen at a dispatch center, then the norm is to generate a report and check with other dispatch centers. If the disturbance is found to be local, then it is ignored. Else, if it is found to be correlated (similar disturbances observed at other dispatch centers), then further diagnostics are conducted. Our goal is to perform this fault analysis automatically using machine learning. We aim to monitor the grid continuously and then in the case of a fault determine the type of the fault as and when it occurs. Apart from just predicting the nature of the fault we aim to give further insight into the fault such as in which bus line the fault had been triggered. The entire process has to be done automatically using machine learning techniques without using any human supervision and using just the current as well as past states of the grid as an input.
